# The dare AICu
This small project was done in a group of two in what we call at 42 **rush**.
In a rush we don't know what we are going to do, and neither who will be your pair,
Friday night at 11:42 pm we receive the guideline, and who you will be working with.
The deadline was set to Sunday night at 11:42 pm.
## AICu
Is an introduction to **IA** where we had to code a game based on matches
where your player must win.
### Rules
There is a fixed number of rows of matches <br />
Players take turns. <br />
Each player can take, on a single row, between 1 and 3 matches <br />
The player who takes the last match, on the last available row, loses. <br />
